## 🎯 Deployment Success Criteria

A successful deployment means:

1. **Smart Contract**: Deployed, verified, and functional on Arbitrum Sepolia
2. **Frontend**: Live, responsive, and integrated with smart contract
3. **Authentication**: Privy integration working seamlessly
4. **User Flow**: Complete purchase and management flow functional
5. **Security**: All security measures implemented and tested
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting in place
7. **Documentation**: Complete documentation for users and developers
8. **Support**: Support infrastructure ready for user questions

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Smart Contract Issues
- **Gas Limit**: Increase gas limit if deployment fails
- **Verification**: Use manual verification if automatic fails
- **Network**: Ensure correct network configuration

### Frontend Issues
- **Environment Variables**: Double-check all environment variables
- **Contract Addresses**: Verify contract addresses are correct
- **Privy Configuration**: Ensure Privy app is properly configured

### Integration Issues
- **Network Mismatch**: Ensure frontend and contract are on same network
- **USDC Approval**: Test USDC approval flow thoroughly
- **Transaction Errors**: Check user balance and gas fees
